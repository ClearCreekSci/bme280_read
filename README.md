# bme280_read
This repository provides a small Python script to read temperature, humidity and barometric pressure over I2C from a connected [Adafruit BME280 module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652). It requires the [smbus2](https://pypi.org/project/smbus2) Python module which can be installed from PyPI. The script is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi that has the primary I2C bus wired to the BME280.
